**SoftTube**

SoftTube is a YouTube client that downloads the videos and thumbnails using youtube-dl, and keeps track of subscriptions using RSS feeds.

For now, it requires a specific MySQL-database, that cannot be created from the application, so the application is of no use for anyone else than me.
